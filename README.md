# Small Python Cyphers

This site is designed to be a precursor to Cryptopals, a more serious and in-depth dive into the world of cryptography. 

Through the exercises, you will learn about basic encryption and decryption techniques, simple methods of frequency analysis to break cyphers, and some of the basic operations used in cryptography (such as MIME, XOR, and other tricks of encoding data)

At some point, this site may become more advanced, but at this moment it remains at an introduction to simple codes and code breaking
